# Cumulus Library

The Cumulus Library is a framework for designing, executing, and distributing SQL queries
packaged as "studies", e.g. for quality monitoring, clinical research, or public health.

If you'd like to begin using the Library now,
start with the [first time setup guide](first-time-setup.md).
