# Cumulus Library

The Cumulus Library is a framework for designing, executing, and distributing SQL queries
packaged as "studies", e.g. for quality monitoring, clinical research, or public health.

If you'd like to begin using the Library now,
start with the [first time setup guide](first-time-setup.md).

## Source Code

Cumulus Library is open source. If you'd like to browse its code or contribute changes yourself, the code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/cumulus-library).
