# criteria versus those that do not.

# This attempts to handle the complexities of generating SQL queries for you,
# but you do need to know a little bit about what your data looks like in the
# database. We recommend that you only attempt to use this after you have decided
# on the first draft of your cohort selection criteria

# has entities matching your selection criteria (probably patients, but it could
# be another base FHIR resource)

#   be the primary ref.
#   - included_cols - a list of columns to join from the table in question. An array
#   of one string string will be included as the column name. An array of two strings
#   will create an alias, like "table_name.first_string AS second_str"
# You can join as many tables as you like.
