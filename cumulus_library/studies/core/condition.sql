-- https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core/StructureDefinition-us-core-condition-encounter-diagnosis.html
-- 
-- Each Condition must have:
--    a category code of “problem-list-item” or “health-concern”
--    a code that identifies the condition (this is available in 
--        core__condition_codable_concepts_all)
--    a patient
-- Each Condition must support:
--    a clinical status of the condition (e.g., active or resolved)
--    a verification status
--    a category code of ‘sdoh’
--    a date of diagnosis*
--    abatement date (in other words, date of resolution or remission)
--    a date when recorded
