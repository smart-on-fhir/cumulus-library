# A note about the `get_template` function:
# As of this writing, the get_template function is used internally by the
# Cumulus team across multiple study repos for creating SQL in databases, both
# from the templates in this repo and in the various other projects (while leveraging
# some of our syntax helper macros, which are auto loaded by this function).
# Breaking changes to these templates will result in a major version bump.

# This API should be usable for your own study efforts - but the documentation
# is all code level. See template_sql for more information.
